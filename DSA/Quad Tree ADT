//Returns trie if qt is a value node quad tree, otherwise returns false 

lu(qt)
//Returns the left-upper sub-quad tree of qt

ru(qt)
//Returns the right-upper sub-quad tree of qt

ll(qt)
//Returns the left-lower sub-quad tree of qt

rl(qt)
//Returns the right-lower sub-quad tree of qt

// ^ These all could be leaf nodes or internal nodes ^
