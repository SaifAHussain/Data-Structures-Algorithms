//Constructors
EmptyQueue: returns an empty queue
push(element, queue) : Also known as enqueue(x), puts value x at the rear of the queue


//Accessors
top(queue): Also known as front(queue), returns the value at front of queue without changing the queue
pop(queue): Also known as dequeue(queue), returns the queue with the front element removed
//if there are no values in the queue, it raises:
EmptyQueueException

isEmpty(queue): says whether the queue is empty

//implementing as a LLWLNP

pop(queue) = delete_beg();
push(x, queue) = insert_end();

//implementing as an array

queue = new int[MAXQUEUE];
front = 0;
size = 0; //When empty queue, front=rear
rear = (front+size) % MAXQUEUE;

top(queue): {
    return queue[front];
}

boolean isEmpty(queue): {
    size == 0;
